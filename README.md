## Usage
1. Install [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage):
   
   `brew install cookiecutter carthage`
   
   Carthage is used as dependency manager by default.
    
2. Run `cookiecutter gh:artemnovichkov/swift-project-template`. No need to create project folder manually, cookiecutter does it for you.

For future runs you can shorten the command to `cookiecutter swift-project-template`. However, if you want to use the most recent template you should still run the full command above. Or just create an alias:
```bash
alias template='cookiecutter gh:artemnovichkov/swift-project-template'
```
